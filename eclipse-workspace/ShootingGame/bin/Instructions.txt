Welcome to Space Conquerors!


**The game is very simple, just shoot down the balls,
score a lot of points and win!!

**Balls of different colours award different points when shot;
Blue-   1 point
Red-    2 points
Green-  3 points
Orange- 4 points
Yellow- 5 points
Cyan-   6 points

**Each time you hit a ball, you gain the points and it respawns
at a random location but it gains more speed,becoming harder
to hit.

**You have 2 methods to gain bonus points;
-Hit the ball whose colour and name appear on the top right
 corner (2 times the score of the ball hit)
-Hit the ball with weight equivalent to the equation that appears
 in the bottom right corner (3 times the score of the ball hit)

**You win by scoring above 150 points,but becareful; you only got
 30 bullets to shoot.

**Your scores will be recorded in the "Highscores" section.

		**Best of luck and enjoy the game!!!**
